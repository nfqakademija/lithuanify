The January bloodbath in Lithuania,"On January 13, 1991, Lithuanian protesters formed a human shield to protect a radio and television center from Soviet forces in the capital Vilnius. What do Lithuanians today think of the bloodshed back then? Lithuanians remember January 13, 1991, as the day on which more than a dozen people lost their lives for their country's independence. According to Lithuanian sources, some of the victims were crushed by Soviet tanks and others were shot to death. On that day, Lithuania abandoned the Soviet legacy and embarked on a path leading to democracy and membership in the EU and NATO.
In the course of the Soviet Union's collapse, Lithuania had re-established independence in 1990. At the beginning of 1991, Moscow demanded the restoration of the Soviet constitution and that Lithuania relinquish its independence. On January 13, 1991, pro-Kremlin forces, backed by the Soviet military, tried to take power in Lithuania, but failed. In response to the bloody events, a referendum was held in which the population confirmed its desire to split from the Soviet Union. Moscow declared the referendum null and void. But, after a failed coup attempt by communist hardliners in Moscow in August of 1991, Lithuania's independence was recognized worldwide. A victory for freedom
""January 13, 1991 is definitely a victorious day for Lithuania. Our country has been fortunate in the time that has passed since the events. The Republic of Lithuania has been established, we have become part of the West and that's what counts,"" said Rimvydas Valatka, editor-in-chief of the Lithuanian magazine ""Veidas"" in an interview with Deutsche Welle.
For Arvydas Anusauskas, a historian and member of the Committee on National Security and Defense in the Lithuanian parliament, January 13 is primarily a symbol of the struggle for independence. ""The younger generations in Lithuania associate this day with struggle and heroism,"" he told DW.
Virginijus Savukynas, director of the Center for Public Policy Strategies, believes January 13 is a day of freedom but, at the same time, should also serve as a reminder that freedom must be fought for, noting that, ""January 13 is also proof that freedom must be protected.""
Gorbachev's role disputed
Arvydas Anusauskas is convinced that a great deal is owed to Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union at the time. According to the Lithuanian parliamentarian, he had stopped the bloodshed. ""I think because of the international publicity, Gorbachev did not dare command the Soviet army to deploy a great number of troops and occupy the Lithuanian parliament. When he found out what actually happened in Vilnius, he put an end to it,"" said Anusauskas.",01/13/1991,83,http://www.bbc.com/sport/hockey/36097431
"With flowers and solemn speeches, Lithuanians mark the 25th anniversary of Soviet crackdown","VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) â€” With flowers and solemn speeches, Lithuanians on Wednesday marked the 25th anniversary of a deadly Soviet crackdown that failed to quash the Baltic country's quest for independence.

Hundreds of people gathered in Vilnius in freezing temperatures to honor the 14 people killed when Soviet troops and tanks moved into a crowd of protesters outside a TV tower on Jan. 13, 1991.

The attacks only emboldened Lithuanians to demand freedom, which they gained later that year.

President Dalia Grybauskaite drew parallels between those events and Ukraine's conflict with Moscow, saying ""we feel a bond of unity with the people of Ukraine whose representatives are among us today.""

It was the first of a series of events planned this year in the Baltic countries to commemorate the end of the Soviet occupation.

The attack on the TV tower in Vilnius and another in neighboring Latvia a week later that left five dead was a last show of force for Soviet troops that had occupied the Baltic countries since World War II.

The bravery and defiance shown by unarmed Lithuanians in the face of Soviet guns and tanks remains a huge source of pride for the country of 3 million. More than 1,000 people were injured in the crackdown.

""We will never forget what happened then,"" said Julius Kazlauskas, a 32-year-old engineer, who came to Parliament with his toddler son.

""I was just a kid back them, but remember my parents were scared,"" he said. ""It was people, not some army, who defended their country and right to be free. And look at us now: We are members of the EU and NATO, our economy is among fastest growing in Europe.""",01/13/1991,236,http://www.london24.com/sport/football/how_england_could_line_up_v_lithuania_tottenham_trio_and_exciting_arsenal_winger_to_start_1_4267785
