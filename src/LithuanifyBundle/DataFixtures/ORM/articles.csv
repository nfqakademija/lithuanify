Ice Hockey World Championship: Great Britain thrash Lithuania,"Great Britain produced their best result in a decade to thrash Lithuania 8-0 at the ice hockey World Championship (Division 1B) in Zagreb.

Captain Jonathan Phillips celebrated his 75th cap with the first goal.

Ashley Tait added the second before the end of the period to put GB in control before six second-period goals completed the rout.

It means two more wins will see Pete Russell's side gain promotion to world ice hockey's second tier.

The victory was their third of the tournament, following defeats of Croatia and Estonia, and their biggest since a 10-0 win over China in 2005.

Great Britain play Romania at 12:00 BST on Friday and then wrap up the tournament against favourites Ukraine on Saturday, also at 12:00 BST. Both games will be streamed live on the BBC Sport website.

Analysis

Seth Bennett, BBC ice hockey commentator in Zagreb

""This was an incredible performance from Great Britain against a Lithuanian side who had beaten them in three of their past four meetings. With leading scorer Robert Dowd held in hospital overnight because of illness, there were concerns as to where the goals would come from.

""But it was a total team performance. Eight goals from eight different scorers showed the kind of depth this team has and if they play like that in their remaining two games it is hard to imagine them not going up.

""In recent years Britain have fallen at the final hurdle, but right now the finish line is in sight and with six periods of hockey to play there is no doubt that they will feel good about their chances of gaining a first promotion since 1993.""",http://www.icehockeyuk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Big-cuddle-GB-v-Lithuania-2016.jpg,1473022800,41,http://www.bbc.com/sport/hockey/36097431
